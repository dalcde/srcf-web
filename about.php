<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Recently, I've received various requests from faculty members to stop uploading my lecture notes, since certain students are using them as substitutes for going to lectures, which is detrimental to their learning. Consequently, from next year onwards, the lecture notes will be uploaded only after the courses have finished (they will be there if you want them for revision).</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>Certain students seem to think that the &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; updated lecture notes can act as a substitute for lectures, since if they skip a lecture, they will be able to catch up immediately afterwards using the notes, which (hopefully) accurately reflects what was lectured on that day. However, this does not work. Among many other reasons, going to lectures and writing down notes makes sure the material goes through your brain, and helps you understand the content. For example, it is so easy to just skim past a proof without looking through the details, and mistakenly think you understand it &mdash; this won't happen if you are forced to write down the full proof presented by the lecturer!</p>

<p>Actually, it would be better if people actually did use the notes to catch up immediately, but I believe in many cases, they are just not bothered. Instead, they start to attempt to catch up only when the next supervision work is due, which makes the situation much worse.</p>

<p>Of course, there are benefits to sharing the notes (or else I wouldn't have done it in the first place). They can be a convenient reference in case people are confused by something in lectures, or a handy source if people from future years want to read ahead, or for people from other subjects or universities wanting to see what we are doing. However, based on what certain supervisors have told me, the notes seem to be doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>Thus a reasonable compromise would be to upload the notes after the course has finished. While one may argue that there will still be a negative impact on future years' students, the effect would be much less. Since the material and presentation may differ from year to year, and lecture notes from previous years feel less like a plausible substitute for lectures (they never are). After all, there are also many other sources of old lecture notes or books students can refer to.</p>

<p>There have been suggestions to take off all my existing notes completely, which I do not agree with. I believe anything out on the internet is out forever, and taking them back is not helpful (for the same reason, I don't believe in things like Snapchat). For example, some of the previous notes can be found on the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, and many people probably already have local copies of the lecture notes. What I do <em>not</em> want to see is people circulating within themselves old versions of the notes, which probably contain a lot more errors than the most up-to-date version.</p>

<h1>Sidenotes</h1>
Also known as &ldquo;comments I cannot figure out where to put&rdquo;.
<ul>
  <li><p>I was initially reluctant to stop uploading my notes, since it felt like &ldquo;punishing&rdquo; the &ldquo;good&rdquo; students because of the undesirable behaviour of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; students (and also university students seem too old to need measures to stop them from skipping lectures, but that is obviously not true). However, the supervisors are probably at a better position to judge the net effect of my uploading my notes, and if they think this is doing more harm than good, that is probably true.</p></li>

  <li><p>Historical context: the original request to stop uploading my notes was made near the end of Lent term 2016. As the term was about to end, and I wasn't attending any lectures in Easter term, I have not taken much action until now.</p></li>

  <li><p>If you have sufficiently legitimate reasons (eg. was very ill for a lecture) and think you can convince me to share (parts of) my notes, feel free to contact me.</p></li>
