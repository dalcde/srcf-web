<p>I am currently a Cambridge mathematics undergraduate at Robinson College, matriculated in 2014. The lecture notes of the mathematics courses I have attended in Cambridge can be found in the <a href="/">Notes</a> page.</p>

<p>My mathematical interests currently lie in (categorical) logic, foundations of mathematics, homotopy theory, (higher) category theory and theoretical physics (but my knowledge in these fields is rather limited).</p>

<p>Elsewhere, I can (usually) be found on the <a href="http://irc.lc/freenode/math/">Freenode ##math irc</a> discussing maths, and I sometimes edit the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/">nLab</a> (well, the tiny subset of which I understand).</p>

<p>The code of this site can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dalcde/srcf-web">GitHub</a> (with some delay).</p>
