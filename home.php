<p>So. I am a Cambridge Maths student. To avoid updating this page every year, which is obviously a tedious task, I'll say that I matriculated in 2014, and you can probably calculate what year I am in. If not, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=years+since+September+2014">this</a> might help.</p>

<p>Initially, my page hosted the notes I have taken during lectures. As time went on, I stuffed more and more (mostly useless) things into my webpage, and it soon became a mess. So I took the time to restructure the site to create something more pleasant. The site used to display my name in a huge font at the top, but I guess it would be more fun to let the visitors try figure it out themselves. No hints provided.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, people seem to be more interested in my notes than this homepage. Hence the default landing page is "Notes", not "Home". For those who don't care about my notes, I apologize.</p>

<p>As you can probably see from the domain name, this site is hosted on the <a href="http://www.srcf.net/">SRCF</a>. Here I'll thank the wonderful sysadmins (myself included) for managing the servers and allowing me to host silly sites.</p>

<p>The code of this site can be found on <a href="https://github.com/dalcde/srcf-web">GitHub</a> and (hopefully) mirrored at the corresponding <a href="dalcde.github.io/srcf-web/">GitHub</a> page.</p>
