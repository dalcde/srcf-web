<p>By (overwhelming!) request of members of the faculty, the notes for the courses in the current term will not be available until the term ends. Please email me (or use other methods to contact me) if you want to obtain a copy of the relevant notes for legitimate purposes.</p>

<p>This is due to many students using the notes as substitutes for going to lectures, which is a terrible idea that in general impedes learning, and thus we hope that making the notes unavailable would improve the situation. While I am rather doubtful of the effectiveness of hiding the notes during term, there will certainly be a slight positive effect, and a small effect is better than none.</p>
